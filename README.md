# Product Quality Root Cause Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates a product quality investigation using root cause analysis
(Fishbone/Ishikawa) to identify issues, analyze customer support data, and propose
preventative product improvements.

## About Me

I approach product quality and customer experience problems by combining data analysis,
root cause analysis, and preventative thinking. My focus is on minimizing customer effort,
reducing repeat issues, and aligning product improvements with measurable business outcomes.

This project reflects how I work as a product quality owner—using structured frameworks
such as Fishbone/Ishikawa and KPI-driven decision-making to improve product reliability
and support efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Recurring product issues led to increased customer support contacts, reduced customer
satisfaction, and operational inefficiencies.

## Data Reviewed
- Customer support tickets
- Defect and failure reports
- Customer feedback trends

## Root Cause Analysis (Fishbone / Ishikawa)
Issues were analyzed across the following categories:
- People
- Process
- Technology
- Hardware

## Key Findings
- Identified primary contributors to recurring product issues
- Discovered gaps in troubleshooting workflows and preventative controls
- Highlighted opportunities for product and process improvements

## Recommended Solutions
- Product and workflow improvements to reduce defects
- Preventative QA measures to minimize future customer impact
- Clear troubleshooting documentation for support and field teams

## Expected Impact
- Reduced customer effort
- Lower support contact volume
- Improved product reliability and customer satisfaction

## Key Metrics & KPIs Monitored
- Customer support contact rate
- Defect and failure rate
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT)
- Product reliability and repeat issue frequency
